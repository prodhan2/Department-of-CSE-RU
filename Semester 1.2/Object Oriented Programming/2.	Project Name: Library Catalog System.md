2.	Project Name: Library Catalog System

Project Description: In this project, you will be designing a simple console-based library catalog system. The system will allow users to manage a collection of books by adding new books, searching for books by title or author, and marking books as borrowed or returned. This project will help you practice basic Java concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and user input/output.

Features:
•	Add Books: Users can add new books to the catalog. Each book should have attributes like title, author, publication year, and ISBN.
•	Search Books: Users can search for books by entering either the title or the author's name. The system should display a list of matching books.
•	Mark Borrowed/Returned: Users can mark a book as borrowed or returned. Keep track of the borrowing status of each book.
•	Display Catalog: Users can view the entire catalog of books, including their details and borrowing status.
•	Exit: Provide an option for users to exit the program.

Implementation:
To implement this project, follow these steps:
•	Book Class: Create a Book class with attributes like title, author, publication year, and ISBN. Include methods to set and get these attributes.
•	Library Class: Create a Library class that will manage the collection of books. It should have methods to add books, search for books, mark books as borrowed or returned, and display the catalog.
•	User Interface: Implement the user interface in the main program. Use a loop to continuously present options to the user (e.g., add a book, search for a book, mark as borrowed/returned, display catalog, exit).
•	User Input/Output: Use Scanner to take user input for various actions and display outputs accordingly.
•	Data Storage: You can use data structures like arrays or ArrayLists to store the collection of books in the library.

Sample Interaction:

Exiting the program. Goodbye!

Notes:
Encourage good class design by properly encapsulating attributes and methods within classes.
Implement error handling for cases like entering incorrect input or searching for non-existent books.
This project can be extended by adding features like user accounts, multiple libraries, and saving data to files.
Remember, the goal of this project is to help you practice Java basics and design principles while creating a functional library catalog system in the console environment.
