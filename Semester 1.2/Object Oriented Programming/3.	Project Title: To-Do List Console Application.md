3.	Project Title: To-Do List Console Application

Project Description: The "To-Do List" console application is designed to help users manage their tasks in a simple and organized manner. Users can add tasks to their list, mark tasks as completed, view the list of tasks, and remove completed tasks from the list.

Features:
•	Add Task: Users can add tasks to the to-do list by providing a task description. The application will assign a unique identifier to each task.
•	Mark as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed by entering the task's identifier. A completed task will be visually differentiated from incomplete tasks in the list.
•	List Tasks: Users can view the list of tasks, including their identifiers, descriptions, and completion status. Incomplete tasks will be shown with a checkbox indicating their status.
•	Remove Completed Tasks: Users can choose to remove completed tasks from the list. This action will help keep the list clutter-free.
•	Exit: Users can exit the application when they're done managing their tasks.

Implementation:
The application can be structured using Java classes and methods. Here's a simplified outline of how the project could be implemented:

Task Class: Create a Task class that represents a single task. Each task should have properties such as an identifier, description, and completion status.

ToDoList Class: Develop a ToDoList class that manages the list of tasks. It should have methods for adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, listing tasks, and removing completed tasks.

Main Class: Build a Main class that serves as the entry point of the application. It should create an instance of the ToDoList class and handle user interactions through the console.

User Input Handling: Implement user input handling to allow users to choose actions (add, mark, list, remove, exit) and provide necessary input (task description, task identifier, etc.).

Console Output: Display relevant information and prompts to users using console output. For example, when listing tasks, show each task's identifier, description, and completion status.
